\chapter{Revision project}

For revision purposes, you may find yourself wishing to tackle a larger Haskell project than those presented by the lab exercises. For this purpose, we have included a past coursework specification in this chapter which you could work on when revising for the exam. This is entirely optional and no marks are available for completion of this project, but it is fully equipped with tests and benchmarks just like the two current coursework projects.
